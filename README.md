# Kerfuffle
"One of the most sub-par lookup tools ever made or your money back!" - John "This Isn't My Real Name" Johnson

This is a command line tool because frankly I hate making gui applications (I don't know how and I'm too lazy to learn)

So just run the program and it should work, lest I messed something really simple up and it doesn't run

It's <100 lines, so you're really getting what you (don't) pay for here

*edit: it's now >200 lines, so I guess you're not getting what you (don't) pay for here?

BUT IT GETS BETTER!!!1
Kerfuffle is now with several more lookup sites and/or tools for things
it's so many lines now I literally can't do this (even though I did)
^
I think we're at 400 now?
added spacing and type specification because those are all the rage

ok bye
